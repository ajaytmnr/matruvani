                            <p>This book has been written on the insistence of a few fellow seekers who felt that my life and experiences with some of the real sages of India over the past twenty-eight years would be interesting and useful to other aspirants on the spiritual path. On hearing their request, I was immediately reminded of the words of one of those saints who told me that only a Self-Realized Soul should write a book on spirituality.</p>
